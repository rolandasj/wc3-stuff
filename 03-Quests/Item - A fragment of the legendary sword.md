You take the quest by walking close to statue.
Go to archeological camp and just outside north should be tree, talk to it
The symbol is in secret lab, on the wall red symbol, right next to Master Bruise boss (satyr)
Go balk to the statue where you originally got the quest.
Write 'Sti' or 'Stee' (should tell you in the quest log as well) may be translation issue or something else.
