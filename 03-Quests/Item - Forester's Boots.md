Go to plague lands and find forester npc. You need bring him apples and sugar.
- Sugar can be bought in capital hydromancer shop
- Apples are found in nerubian 160 area. To access it you need go to 2nd purple portal in capital and walk accross the wall to the area. Pretty weird i know.
Bring those back to forester and he will give you boots.
These can be ubgraded after you have killed enough monsters with them.
Talk again to the forester, he will give cider.
Bring cider to Dragoo in ashenvale forest on a hill. He will ask you to bring nuts.
Nuts can be found in 112-115 area where the mouse is. Try turning the camera and whatnot, was very difficult to fucking click on it. Good luck.
Bring nuts to the forester and then go back to dragoon. he will ask you to get hunt sphinx and get his secret.
Sphinx is located in 40-50 dead forest. Obsidian guardian or whatever. He may give you a riddle. I do not know how many there is.
But if the riddle is: Why do girls in paris have red hairs? Then the answer is 'on the ground'
Kill sphinx get his secret, return to dragoon with huntsman boots. Wait a bit until hes done, he will give you Dragoon boots.
