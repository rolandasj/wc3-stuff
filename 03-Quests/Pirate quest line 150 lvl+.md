You start by sailing to the Vistula Island. You can get ship north of plague lands into swamp and more north.
Theres a quest to bring meat from the Autumn village. Talk to the elf npc in the town, will give meat. (not sure if connected to anything)
1st quest will be to kill pirates, kill then return.
2nd quest will be to free the archer, go kill pirates until key to cage drops. Pick the key and check one of the cages (in my case it was bottom cage where 3 is)
