Take the quest in the capital. After you will walk into this island, you start walking from before crossing the bridge on the left side through water. Talk to him, go in portal that spawns, kill boss, take the pot, go back via portal talk to npc. Take the signet or whatever that npc drops (may be droped right under himself). Return to Jaina. Thats it. It is saved, so no need to do every time.
