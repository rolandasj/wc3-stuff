You start the quest in ice Fort. Tells you to kill 45 trolls.
After it tells you kill spider and activate 3 obelisks.
Spider drops activation item, so you need kill over and over again for them.
After you activated...

Should tell you to kill the Grinch. To get to him you need go to 2nd capital purple portal to the spider statue.
There are towers that one shot you, so you need pass them somehow. One way is to get potion that makes u invincible for short period from snowman.
Once you pass towers theres a barrier and a lever. You need to press the lever via ranged attack or a summon. I have used 'magic fire' to summon phoenix.
Continue the path and youll find Grinch. Kill him and return to tuskar.
He tells you to save 6 children. Cages with children appear in ice fort area. 1 cage at a time. Save them.
After done, go talk to Arthas in capital.
Now you can kill Kransparus. He is located where Grinch was, gates will be open this time.
