1st key drops from flooded valley from naga siren boss, 2nd key is the cave bellow archeology camp, kill the boss. To enter you will need flint and torch for the cave. You can buy flint (bandage looking item at hydromancer) and torch you can get in kobold mines (picture, south of boss, close to mushroom check picture). 
Once you have both keys bring to flooded valey (picture for location)
