Once you reach 160 lvl, nothing will give you exp except. Bosses that have stats (str,agi,int), and mobs 160 + (starting with 161).
Personally i only found them in underworld. To access underworld, you need kill sargeras and get his achiv. Only then you can access underworld both on normal or hell.
Bosses that i found to give exp at 160+ : Ice Horror, Admiral, Undertaker, Demon Arthas and Pernicious spirit (dremora garden quest)

Shandris is in 3rd purple portal in capital

If you kill cow with butchers axe you will get meat carcas.
It can be used for a quest to feed hungry hunter
It will later requrie more meat or fried meat.
with salt and spices  you can make fried carcas and feed him again
