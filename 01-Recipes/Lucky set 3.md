Once you have lucky set 2, talk to Po, he will give you a quest. He gives different quest depending on lucky set level. On finish it will give the set recipe
In Archipelago town, do the quest to kill mobs, get archeology tools, destroy barrel and get shovel (barrel is in town under golden cube). If shovel does not appear it may rip and need rmk. Dont forget to have quest from Po first. Bring it to secret lab, east (right) to the maze area and you should get sun or something, return to po.
