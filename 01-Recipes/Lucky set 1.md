Amulet of luck is from quest. This quest needs to be taken before you take the quest "The leader" from the Capital city otherwise this quest will not be available. Npc is located in abandoned mines (kobold). Go kill bandit leader (you need quest so summon him, can be taken in capital city), he will drop a key. With that key unlock the cage and lead the kobold back where u took the quest. After pick the missing material and return.
